# MARVEL-HOME-PAGE
only with HTML &amp; CSS

This is my first official project, Marvel site is look like this on 29oct
this project was only by HTML & CSS and using a preproccesor (SASS).


unfortunately I coudn't get the acuall pictures so I used random picture and I tried to do my best so pictures could be relative to texts ,
pictures are high resolution so site may load a little slow but in high quality,
the page is fully responsive
